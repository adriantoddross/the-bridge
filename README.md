# ImpactNigeria.org

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) and uses [Material UI](material-ui.com/) for styling.

## Project Summary

Curated database of social impact organizations based in Nigeria that are making an impact in the lives of a large number of people so that Nigerians in the diaspora can partner with, volunteer their time and skills and/or donate money to.

### Background

Nigerians have a culture of social support, rallying around family and friends in times of need. This is in part due to the absence of a government established social safety net. Nigerians in the diaspora emigrated with those values and do their part to keep it going by remitting money to family back in their home country. They also go a step further by supporting philanthropic causes connected to Nigeria. Majority of Nigerians in the diaspora overwhelmingly support philanthropic causes in Nigeria indirectly by donating money. However, it can be challenging identifying worthy nonprofit organizations in Nigeria that have a wide reach and can make an impact in the lives of a large number of people.

### Why
The exchange rate is such that foreign currency when converted to local Naira yields a large amount of money and because the need is great, the financial impact can go further. Most people want to give more of their time, talent and treasure but are held back because they do not know of nonprofits, how they can use their skills to help or are wary of how the funds that are donated would be used. 

### Success Metrics

- Featured organizations will see an increase in donations
- Newsletter subscriptions
